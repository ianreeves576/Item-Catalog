# Restaurants and Menus

The first step is to setup the `.env` file to hold all of the environment variables that are needed to connect to the APIs.  To do so, run `cp .env.example .env`, which will copy the example file to the .env file.  This file is not committed to the Git repo.  

After signing up for an app on facebook and google, fill in the values in their appropriate places in the `.env` file.  These will automatically cascade to the rest of the app.

The database used by default is restaurantmenuwithusers.db.  To change to another database engine, look in the `database_setup.py` file and change the engine to whatever is appropriate for your use case.

To start using the program, run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the dependencies.

To re-run the base seeds, run `python lotsofmenus.py`.

To start up the app, run either:

```shell
export FLASK_APP=project.py
flask run
```

Or 
```shell
python project.py
```
